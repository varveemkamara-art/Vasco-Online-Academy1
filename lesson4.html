  <h2>Lesson 4: Files and Folders</h2>

  <h3>What Is a File?</h3>
<p>
A file is a digital item that stores information on a computer, phone, or other electronic device.
It can contain text, pictures, videos, music, or data created by a program.
</p>

<p>
Common examples of files include Word documents, PDF books, photos, audio recordings, and videos.
Each file has a specific name and an extension, such as .docx, .pdf, .jpg, or .mp3, which helps the computer know what type of file it is.
</p>

<p>
Files allow users to save their work so it can be opened, edited, or shared later.
When you write a document, take a photo, or download something from the internet, it is saved as a file.
</p>

<p>
Without files, important information would disappear once a computer or application is closed.
That is why saving files regularly is very important when using a computer.
</p>

<h3>What Is a Folder?</h3>
<p>
A folder is a digital container used to store and organize files on a computer.
It works like a physical folder used to hold papers in an office or school.
</p>

<p>
Folders help users arrange files in an orderly way.
For example, a student can have separate folders for school work, pictures, videos, and documents.
</p>

<p>
Folders can also contain other folders, known as subfolders.
This makes it easier to group related files together and quickly find what you need.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Files are used to store information, while folders are used to organize those files.
Proper use of folders keeps your computer clean, saves time, and helps prevent loss of important work.
